# Exploding Cats Card Game
A final group project for CSC413 Software Development.

## Project Description
A simple card game using Java along with Spark web framework, React frontend, and mongoDB database. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the project ended up being done with only myself and 1 other person. Although we were not able to complete the full project, the backend was fully functional.
