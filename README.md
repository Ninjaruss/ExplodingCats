# Exploding Cats Card Game
A final group project for CSC413 Software Development Fall 2019.

## Members
Russell Azucenas - Backend Developer  
Tyler Hoh - Frontend Developer 

## Project Description
A simple card game using Java along with Spark web framework, React frontend, and mongoDB database. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the project ended up being done with only myself and 1 other person. Although we were not able to complete the full project, the backend was fully functional.

## What I Learned
- Management of multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- Basic web project organization
- Usage of lambda functions for routing
- Importing dependencies using maven
- Object design for database and routing
- Response building for HTTP
